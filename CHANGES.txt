0.9.2009xxxx
	* Added the XKCD example from the Wiki.

	* Fixed apps in examples to use req.scriptURI instead of the
	web-server dependent CGI variable SCRIPT_NAME.

0.9.20090201
	* Fixed bug #14765: req.scriptURI has problems with encoded
	URI:s.

	* Fixed problems with the init script that made chkconfig not
	recognize it.

	* The XMIME/XMTP parser and serializer how handles all text/*
	MIME types, not just text/plain.

	* esxx.include now takes a secondary argument, scope, which
	can be used to specify in what scope the included file should 
	be evaluated in.  If unspecified, the global scope is used
	just like before.

	* When using esxx.include from a function, files are now
	first resolved relative the working directory.

	* esxx.global is now available, and refers to the global
	scope.
	
	* The HTTP protocol handler now simply throws an ESXX.Response
	object if the HTTP status in load(), save(), append() or
	remove() is not 2xx.

	* Added IPS (OpenSolaris) package support, including SVC
	management script and manifest.

	* Added proper PackageMaker (OSX), DEB and RPM support. CPack
	is now only used for the Windows packages.

	* Added ESXX.Response methods: toString(), valueOf() and
	[from Java] getDefaultValue().

	* Added a dns: URI protocol handler, with LDAP URI-inspired
	query part.

	* The --no-handler option now takes a regex argument which
	is matched against SERVER_SOFTWARE. This makes it possible
	to use both Apache and Lighttpd with the same ESXX server
	by specifying "--no-handler=lighttpd.*" (which happens to
	be the default, so you don't actually have to specify it).

	* SOAP handlers can now match on SOAPAction and URI just like
	HTTP handlers.

	* XSLT stylesheets can now match on content type and URI,
	similar to HTTP and SOAP handlers.

	* Added a "javaURI" property to the URI class.

	* Added include files "json2.js" (from json.org) and
	"esxx/harmony.js", which adds a few useful functions from 
	the current ECMAScript 3.1 proposal.

	* Removed setLevel() from the Logger class in favour of a
        "level" propery on the prototype object.

	* Upgraded to Rhino 1.7 release 2 RC3.

	* Upgraded embedded H2 to 1.1.107, 2009-01-24.

0.9.20081101
	* Bug fixes as usual.

	* Upgraded to Rhino 1.7 release 2 PRERELEASE 2008 09 30, so we
	can extend abstract Java classes, which didn't work in 1.7r1.

	* esxx.document can now be modified.

	* Enabled a proper https URI implementation.

	* New esxx.wait signature: esxx.wait(mutex, timeout,
	function), which waits on mutex until function returns true.

	* The URI constructor now allows {...} syntax and a parameter
	object to automatically build proper URIs. The file URI class
	will also refuse URIs with encoded path separators in then.

	* The Request object now has requestURI, scriptURI, scriptName
	and pathInfo properties.

	* Request.query now only contains parameters from the
	URI. 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'-encoded data is now
	in Request.message.

	* Added Request.contentType, which contains the basic content
	type (without parameters).

	* The application's error handler may now return null or
	undefined to make it act as if there were not error handler
	installed at all.

	* Added esxx/Object.js include file, which adds extras to the
	Object class. Currently, it only adds $(), which can be used
	to sanitize the 'this' variable in closures.

	* Added --no-handler option, for web servers that invoke
	FastCGI servers without an extra file type handler, such as
	lighttpd.

	* Embedded H2 updated to 1.1.102, 2008-10-24.

	* The stylesheets are now independent from the applications
	and may be viewed and unloaded via JMX. It's also possible to 
	view runtime statistics of individual stylesheets.

	* Added support for running multiple ESXX instances via init
	scripts.

	* Command line script files now reads config file from
	/etc/{default,defaults,sysconfig}/esxx-js so remote JMX ports
	do not interfer with scripts.

	* Moved global constructors Logger, Request and Response to
	ESXX.Logger, ESXX.Request and ESXX.Response in order to reduce
	the number of ESXX-introduced global variables. URI stays.

	* New class, ESXX.LRUCache. New magic property, esxx.tls,
	which is a per-application, per-thread LRUCache object, and
	non-magic esxx.pls, which is just a per-application LRUCache.

	* Added a multipart/form-data parser to handle HTTP file
	uploads.

	* Added timer handler support.

	* All time parameters are now in seconds (may be decimal),
	including system properties, methods in ESXX and LRUCache, and
	the <timer> element's attributes.

0.9.20080927
	* Fixed a bug that closed System.in in script mode, causing
	System.console() to return null.

	* When using the built-in HTTP server, a body will never be
	sent when the status code is 1xx, 204 or 304, as per HTTP
	spec.

0.9.20080924
	* Upgraded to HtmlCleaner 2.1.

	* Upgraded to HTTPClient 4.0 beta 1 and HTTPCore 4.0 beta 2.

	* When creating a new URI object from an old, also copy all of
	the old object's properties (such as auth etc).

	* Added code for application/x-www-form-urlencoded encoding in
	responses (and thus HTTP URI requests).

	* Recognize Apache's Authorization "CGI" environment variable
	as an HTTP header.

0.9.20080821
	* Loads of bug fixes.

	* Added getScriptFilename(), getPathInfo(), getScriptName() to
	Request object.

	* Disabled validate-if-schema feature on XML parser.

	* Added exit handler support, to execute JS code when an app
	is being unloaded.

	* The error handler now receives (req, ex) arguments.

	* Added 'buffered' property to the Response object, which
	makes ESXX buffer the response in RAM, in order to be able to provide
	the Content-Length HTTP header.

	* Added JMX support. Apps can be inspected and unloaded via
	JConsole.

	* Init script now work on RHEL/CentOS 4.x.

0.9.20080619
	* Initial binary release.
