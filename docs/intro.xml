    <title>Introduction</title>
    
    <para>In the late 90's, I was involved in the development of a one
of the first Web/XML application servers. During that time, we realized
the benefits of using data-driven programming for server-based web
applications. In this context, data-driven programming means that the
data that is to be returned as response to a request is generated and
then gradually refined until it reaches the user, most often in the form
of an (X)HTML page, using plain XML as intermediate format.</para>

    <para>By focusing solely on <emphasis>what</emphasis> to present to
the user in the logic stage and not <emphasis>how</emphasis>, the
programmer can focus on what he or she is good at, and leave
presentation and graphical design to those that knows this stuff.</para>

    <para>Six years later<footnote> <para>(during which I was mainly
working as a hardware and low-level software engineer and not really
<quote>in touch</quote> with what was going on on the web)</para>
</footnote>, I find that people are <emphasis>still</emphasis> mixing
HTML and server-side code on a regular basis.</para>
