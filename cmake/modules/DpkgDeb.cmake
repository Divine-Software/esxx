# DpkgDeb : Create debian packages for your projects and sub projects. Written by Mehdi Rabah
# Was heavily inspired by UseDebian (Mathieu Malaterre) and UseRPMTools (TSP Team) modules

# need /usr/bin/dpkg

# USAGE : ADD_DEBIAN_PACKAGE ( DEB_TARGET_NAME [CONTROL_FILE] )  
# You need to set the control file either by setting these variables
# or by giving as second parameter the path to the control file you want to use
# If you choose to set the variables, you must set the mandatory variables:
# (see man 5 deb-control for more details)
#
# -- MANDATORY Variables
# Package: ${PACKAGE_NAME}. Must be a lowercase string
# Version: ${PACKAGE_VERSION}. Like 1.1.0
# Release: ${PACKAGE_RELEASE}. A number beetween 0 and 9
# Maintainer: ${PACKAGE_MAINTAINER_NAME} and ${PACKAGE_MAINTAINER_EMAIL}. 
# Description summary: ${PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_SUMMARY}. Project summary
# Description : ${PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION}. Warning : for now, use of special characters (>, (, ', ... ) is not allowed
#
# -- OPTIONAL Variables 
# Architecture: ${DEBIAN_ARCHITECTURE}, by default i386 for intel on debian like
# Depends: ${PACKAGE_DEPENDS}
# Section: ${PACKAGE_SECTION}
# Priority: ${PACKAGE_PRIORITY}
# Essential: ${PACKAGE_ESSENTIAL}
# Source: ${PACKAGE_SOURCE}
# Pre-Depends: ${PACKAGE_PREDEPENDS}
# Recommends: ${PACKAGE_RECOMMENDS}
# Suggests: ${PACKAGE_SUGGESTS}
# Breaks: ${PACKAGE_BREAKS}
# Conflicts: ${PACKAGE_CONFLICTS}
# Replaces: ${PACKAGE_REPLACES}
# Provides: ${PACKAGE_PROVIDES}

# TODO: Make clean does not clean the DEBIAN_DIR folder
# TODO: use objdump -p to automatically generate depedencies (cf dh_makeshlibs)
